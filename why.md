# Why ?

## COST REDUCTION

Instead of duplicating IT infrastructure, licenses, software, and staff in each country or business unit, the Shared Service Center (SSC) consolidates resources in one place, reducing operational costs (e.g., 20–30% savings on the IT budget).

_Key Points_

- Resource Centralization
  
Consolidate infrastructure, software licenses and roles into a single SSC to eliminate duplication and reduce recurring costs.

- Economies of Scale
  
Centralized procurement (software licenses, hardware, cloud services) and a higher service volume enable better vendor pricing and volume discounts.

- Lower Labor Costs
  
Establish SSCs in locations with lower labor costs to achieve cost advantages while delivering services globally.

## Operational Efficiency

- Centralized teams specialize in service delivery (e.g., support, infrastructure, development).

- Streamlined processes and standardized service levels (SLAs).

- Easier automation and performance monitoring.

## Standardization and Governance

- Uniform IT policies, tools, and cybersecurity standards.

- Easier compliance with regulations and audits.

- Consistent technology architecture across the enterprise.

## Strategic Alignment

- Frees local business units to focus on their core operations.

- SSC operates as an internal service provider aligned with corporate IT strategy.

- Supports digital transformation initiatives across the group.

## Better Support and Collaboration

- The SSC acts as a single point of contact for all daughter companies.

- Common ticketing systems, knowledge bases, and SLAs make support predictable and transparent.

- Encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing between subsidiaries.
