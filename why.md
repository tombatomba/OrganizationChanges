# Why ?

##COST REDUCTION

Resource Centralization:

Instead of duplicating IT infrastructure, licenses, software, and staff in each country or business unit, the Shared Service Center (SSC) consolidates resources in one place, reducing operational costs (e.g., 20â€“30% savings on the IT budget).

_Key Points_

- Resource Centralization
  
Consolidate infrastructure, software licenses and roles into a single SSC to eliminate duplication and reduce recurring costs.

- Economies of Scale
  
Centralized procurement (software licenses, hardware, cloud services) and a higher service volume enable better vendor pricing and volume discounts.

- Lower Labor Costs
  
Establish SSCs in locations with lower labor costs to achieve cost advantages while delivering services globally.
